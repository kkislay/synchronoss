Using JUnit 4.10 or later:
1) Build on the supplied code and extend the count API so that if a numeric string is passed to this API, it will instead count how many times this string occurs on the stack.
    - For example if a stack contains the following three values {"99","7","99"}
      - count("99") should return 2
      - count("7") should return 1
      - count() will continue to return 3 (a count of all numeric strings on the stack).

2) Build on the supplied test class to write a complete set of JUnit test assertions for the StackAPI class based on the javadoc. Please also include tests for the extended count API.

Test Details:
- Negative/error test cases must be included.
- The higher the test coverage, the better.
- The less duplication in your tests, the better
- The only code you should change in StackApi.java or StackImplementation.java is to add in new functionality as described in point 1) above.
- Please email back a tarball like the one you received containing the completed tests and code change.Using JUnit 4.10 or later:
